NAME
----
viz-paraview - VizStack script to launch ParaView on tiled displays in sort-first as well as sort-last rendering mode.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*viz-paraview* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The viz-paraview script starts a ParaView session on a tiled display.
ParaView needs to be separately compiled and installed with MPI
support. The DISPLAY env variable needs to be setup for the GUI to 
popup on the local screen. If the script is run in the server only
mode, then pvserver's are started on the remote tiled display and
the server and port are printed on the command-line.
In this case there is no need to setup the DISPLAY env variable.
After the server is started, the client can be run on the users local desktop
and one can connect to the remote server. Note that the firewall ports
need to opened on the server to enable this mode of operation. 

The script has 2 modes of operation, Distributed Rendering (DR)
mode and Tiled Display(TD) mode. In DR mode, render GPUs are specified 
using the -r option and the display mode of the X server with the -m option. 
Now the loaded dataset is rendered in a distributed mode by ParaView.
In the TD mode, a Tiled Display specified in resource_group_config.xml
is used to render model.

ParaView has a dependency on MPI, so it needs to be compiled with MPI
support to enable the above scenarios. Also the paths for the MPI
libraries needs to be setup before running viz-paraview script.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h, --help*::
     show this help message and exit

*-t DISPLAY_TILE, --tiled-display=DISPLAY_TILE*::
    The tiled display to use for the job.

*-m DISPLAY_MODE, --display-mode=DISPLAY_MODE*::
    The resolution to run the X server at.

*-r, --render-servers=NUM_RENDER_GPUS*::
     The number of GPUs to use for offscreen rendering.
     By default, shared GPUs are allocated.

*-x, --exclusive*::
     Allocate dedicated GPUs for rendering. This is useful
     if you intend to do GPU intensive operations like 
     volume rendering. Applicable only with -r.

*-p, --port=SERVER_PORT*::
     The port on which to start the ParaView server.

*-l, --local*::
     By default, this scripts starts the ParaView server, but no
     client. If you want the script to run the ParaView client on
     the local desktop, then use this option.

*-c, --connect-to=CLIENT*::
     Connect to a listening Paraview client. Use this if outgoing 
     firewall connections are allowed.

*--mpilib=MPILIB*::
     The MPI library to use. Use the library that the ParaView server 
     is compiled with. Valid values are 'hpmpi', 'openmpi' and 'mpich'.
     Defaults to 'openmpi'.

*--no-framelock*::
     VizStack sets up framelock if this is enabled in the configuration of 
     the used tiled display.  Framelock provides hardware synchronization of 
     all the displays in the Tiled Display. If your framelock chain or tiled 
     display is not setup properly for framelock, then ParaView will not be started. 
     Use this option if framelock setup fails, but you want to use the tiled 
     display without framelock.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure (unable to allocate resources, termination via
    ^C, any other abnormal termination)

EXAMPLES
--------

To run ParaView in distributed rendering mode using 4 shared GPUs,

*# viz-paraview -r 4*

This will start a ParaView server with 4 GPUs. You will need to 
connect to the ParaView server using a ParaView client from your
desktop.

To run ParaView in tiled display mode and the assuming the name of
the defined tiled display is 'front-wall'.

*# viz-paraview -t front-wall*

To start the server with a display mode of 1280x1024.

*# viz-paraview -t front-wall -m 1280x1024*

To run ParaView with a local GUI :

*# viz-paraview -t front-wall --local*
