NAME
----
viz-paraview - VizStack script to launch ParaView on tiled displays in sort-first as well as sort-last rendering mode.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*viz-paraview* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The viz-paraview script starts a ParaView session on a tiled display.
ParaView needs to be separately compiled and installed with MPI
support. The DISPLAY env variable needs to be setup for the GUI to 
popup on the local screen. If the script is run in the server only
mode, then pvserver's are started on the remote tiled display and
the server and port are printed on the command-line.
In this case there is no need to setup the DISPLAY env variable.
After the server is started, the client can be run on the users local desktop
and one can connect to the remote server. Note that the firewall ports
need to opened on the server to enable this mode of operation. 

The script has 2 modes of operation, Distributed Rendering (DR)
mode and Tiled Display(TD) mode. In DR mode, render GPUs are specified 
using the -r option and the display mode of the X server with the -m option. 
Now the loaded dataset is rendered in a distributed mode by ParaView.
In the TD mode, a Tiled Display specified in resource_group_config.xml
is used to render model.

ParaView has a dependency on MPI, so it needs to be compiled with MPI
support to enable the above scenarios. Also the paths for the MPI
libraries needs to be setup before running viz-paraview script.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h, --help*::
     show this help message and exit

*-t DISPLAY_TILE, --tiled-display=DISPLAY_TILE*::
    The tiled display to use for the job.

*-m DISPLAY_MODE, --display-mode=DISPLAY_MODE*::
    The resolution to run the X server at.

*-s, --stereo*::
     Turns on stereographic display, if present in the display devices.

*-r, --render-servers=NUM_RENDER_GPUS*::
     The number of render nodes to use.

*-p, --port=SERVER_PORT*::
     The port on which the server connects to the client.

*--server-only*::
	Only starts the servers, one can connect using a client 
	running on the local desktop.

*--no-framelock*::
        If framelock is possible, then the script will try to
	enable framelock. If your framelock chain or tiled
        display is not setup properly for framelock, then this
        will fail. Use this if you want to just run the
        desktop without attempting framelock.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure (unable to allocate resources, termination via
    ^C, any other abnormal termination)

EXAMPLES
--------

To run ParaView in tiled display mode and the assuming the name of
the defined tiled display is 'front-wall'.

*# viz-paraview -t front-wall*

to start the server with a display mode of 1280x1024.

*# viz-paraview -t front-wall -m 1280x1024*

To run ParaView in distributed rendering mode using 4 GPUs,

*# viz-paraview -r 4 -m 1600x1200*

note that -m is compulsory in distributed rendering mode.
To run ParaView in server only mode, where no local GUI
is started and the user connects to the server by starting
the client on his local desktop

*# viz-paraview -t front-wall --server-only*

Note that in this mode, the firewall port needs to opened
on the server side, so that the client can connect.
