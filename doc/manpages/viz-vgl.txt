NAME
----
viz-vgl - runs an application using VirtualGL, using the VirtualGL Image Transport if needed.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*viz-vgl* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The viz-vgl(1) command runs an application using VirtualGL,
using the VGL Image Transport if needed.  The GUI of the 
application runs on the local X server while the OpenGL 
rendering happens on an allocated GPU.

You must execute this script either inside an X desktop
session, or inside an SSH session with X11 forwarding 
enabled. This script will automatically pick up a GPU for
you to use.  You may also choose a GPU by passing one/more
of the options described below.

If the allocated GPU is on a different node, then this script
uses VGL Image Transport with X11 Forwarding, over an SSH 
connection. If you haven't setup passwordless SSH, then you'll
be prompted for a password.  The X11 traffic generated by the
application passes via SSH, and is always encrypted.


OPTIONS
-------
*-s, --stereo*::
    Use this to run an application in stereo mode.  You may run an
    application in stereo, provided that the local X server is setup to
    enable Quad Buffered Stereo.

*-x, --exclusive*::
    Request exclusive access to a GPU. By default, a shared GPU is allocated.
    Use this option to run GPU-intensive applications or for purposes like
    benchmarking. Stereo usage always allocates a complete GPU.

*--gpu-type*='TYPE'::
    Use a specific type of GPU 'TYPE' for this remote session. Note that  
    GPU types will have spaces in it, so you will need to quote the string.

*--shell*::
    Use this option to start a shell after allocating a GPU. You may use the
    'vglrun' command inside this shell to run one/more OpenGL applications.

*-a, --allocate-from*='NODE'::
    Allocate the GPU on host 'NODE'. If you use this option multiple times, 
    then a single GPU from one of the specified hosts will be used. Note that
    the allocation is independent of the order in which the hostnames are 
    specified on the command line. This option cannot be used if -b is used.

*-c, --compress*::
    Compress images using JPEG compression. By default, no compression is used.
    This option cannot be used with --x11-draw.

*--secure*::
    Use this option to encrypt the application's image stream. By default the 
    application's image stream is left unencrypted. This results in maximum 
    performance. Using this option will encrypt the images using SSL, thereby
    reducing performance.  Enable this if you want absolute security. Also 
    note that this option only takes effect if the allocated GPU is on a 
    different node compared to where this script runs.

*--x11-draw*::
    Use this option if are unable to use the VirtualGL client on your local X
    server. This will force VirtualGL to send uncompressed 3D images directly
    to your X server. Using this option will typically result in lower 
    performance. However, it can help you get your application up and running
    even if you have nothing more than just a local X server.

*--show-gpu-types*::
    Prints out a list of GPU types that are potentially available for allocation.

*-h, --help*::
    Prints this message.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure (unable to allocate resources, termination via
    ^C, any other abnormal termination)


EXAMPLES
--------

Hello, VirtualGL!

*# viz_vgl glxgears*

Hello, VirtualGL Stereo!

*# viz_vgl -s -- glxgears -stereo*

Usage of -- allows you to run an application which itself
uses options which begin with a hyphen.

Note that the glxgears binary that comes with SLES10.2 does
not support the stereo option. To run the stereo application,
your local desktop must also be running with stereo enabled.

Let's say you have a cygwin X server on your Windows desktop.
SSH to the VizStack system with X11 forwarding (ssh -x).
After these steps, you can run any application, e.g.,

*# viz_vgl --x11-draw googleearth*

should cause Google Earth to pop up on your windows desktop.
