NAME
----
viz-tvnc - starts a remote desktop session using TurboVNC, with VirtualGL
setup for running accelerated OpenGL applications.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*viz-tvnc* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The viz-tvnc(1) command starts an interactive remote desktop session
for you.  A GPU for is picked up automatically for you to use for 
OpenGL rendering.  You may also choose a specific type of GPU.

After starting the session, you will need to connect to the session
using the TurboVNC client. The TurboVNC client is typically installed on
your desktop or laptop.

For a better user experience, consider installing and using the
graphical VizStack Remote Access tools.

OPTIONS
-------
*-g, --geometry*='GEOMETRY'::
    The resolution to run the desktop at. This can be any '<width>x<height>'
    formatted value. The geometry does not need to match any display device 
    resolution. Width needs to be a multiple of 8, and <width>x<height> may 
    not be lesser than '304x200'. Note that larger resolutions may result in
    higher network bandwidth usage, CPU utilization and in general, lower
    performance.

*-c, --connect-to*='HOST'::
    This parameter needs to be in the format \"host[:port]". Tells 
    the started TurboVNC server to connect to a listening TurboVNC 
    viewer on the given host and port. You need to start the TurboVNC 
    client in the "listening" mode prior to running this script. If
    you did not specify a listening port number explicitly, then the
    client will be listening on port 5500, and this is taken as the
    default port. Note that failure to connect the TurboVNC server
    to the specified client is not treated as a failure, and the 
    desktop session continues to run.

*-b, --batch-mode*::
    Use this if you are running this script via a batch scheduler. This will 
    direct the script to allocate resources on the machine where the script
    gets run by the scheduler.

*--gpu-type*='TYPE'::
    Use a specific type of GPU 'TYPE' for this remote session. Note that  
    GPU types will have spaces in it, so you will need to quote the string.

*-a, --allocate-from*='NODE'::
    Allocate the GPU on host 'NODE'. If you use this option multiple times, 
    then a single GPU from one of the specified hosts will be used. Note that
    the allocation is independent of the order in which the hostnames are 
    specified on the command line. This option cannot be used if -b is used.

*--show-gpu-types*::
    Prints out a list of GPU types that are potentially available for allocation.

*-h, --help*::
    Prints this message.

*--automation*::
    This option is intended for automation use by the VizStack Remote Access 
    tools. Not intended for command line usage.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Failure (unable to allocate resources, termination via
    ^C, any other abnormal termination)


EXAMPLES
--------

To get a desktop running at a default resolution, use

*# viz_tvnc*

On success, this will print out the address to which you need
to connect using the TurboVNC clent.  Logout of the desktop
when you are done.  Terminating the script by pressing ^C
is also one way to give up the desktop, but this is not
recommended as you may loose work.

To start a desktop at resolution 1144x1000, use

*# viz_tvnc -g 1144x1000*

To start the same desktop on a Quadro FX 5800 GPU, you would use

*# viz_tvnc --gpu-type="Quadro FX 5800" -g 1144x1000*

From a user experience point of view, you would want
the remote desktop to automatically show up on your 
local dekstop.  To achieve this, you need to start a 
TurboVNC client in the "listen" mode on your desktop.
Follow that up by running this command

*#viz_tvnc -c <desktop_hostname>*

The remote desktop should now pop up on your dekstop.
